/// Fluent builder constructing a request to `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`.

/// <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider. Example providers include the OAuth 2.0 providers Login with Amazon and Facebook, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider such as Google or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html">Amazon Cognito federated identities</a>.</p> <note>
/// <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.</p>
/// <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// </note>
/// <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term Amazon Web Services credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term Amazon Web Services credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to Amazon Web Services service API operations.</p>
/// <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p>
/// <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p>
/// <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p>
/// <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p>
/// <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p> <b>Tags</b> </p>
/// <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length">IAM and STS Character Limits</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note>
/// <p>An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.</p>
/// </note>
/// <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with the same key.</p>
/// <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p> <b>Identities</b> </p>
/// <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. </p> <important>
/// <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">Subject</a> of the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes">suggested in the OIDC specification</a>.</p>
